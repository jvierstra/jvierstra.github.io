title: Cis-regulatory encoding of cell identity and fate potential
excerpt: >
         Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all 
         organisms. We use both in vivo and ex vivo human hematopoiesis as model systems to finely map the temporal dynamics of
         chromatin accessbility and gene expression during development.
